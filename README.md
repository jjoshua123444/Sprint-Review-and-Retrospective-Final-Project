*How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves gathering and analyzing data on what users want and need from a software application. This can be achieved through various research methods. Once user needs have been identified, user stories can be created to capture the requirements from the user's perspective. User stories help in breaking down the requirements into smaller, more manageable parts, making it easier to prioritize and implement them into the program. By using user stories, developers can stay focused on delivering features that align with the user's needs and expectations, ultimately resulting in a more user-friendly and effective program. 

*How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When approaching program development, it is important to have a clear understanding of the project requirements, user needs, and technical constraints. A structured approach, such as agile methodology, can help manage the development process, prioritize tasks, and deliver features in an iterative and incremental way. This involves breaking down the development process into smaller, manageable parts or sprints, testing and evaluating the work frequently, and adapting the project plan as necessary based on feedback. In my future development work, I hope to incorporate agile processes such as Scrum to ensure that projects are delivered on time, within budget, and with high quality. Additionally, I aim to maintain effective communication and collaboration with team members and stakeholders throughout the development process to ensure that the final product meets the requirements and expectations of all parties involved. 

*What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves having a collaborative mindset and a willingness to work towards a common goal. This includes being an effective communicator, actively listening to team members, providing constructive feedback, and being open to receiving feedback. Good team members are also proactive in their work, taking initiative and being accountable for their tasks and responsibilities. They are willing to learn and adapt to new technologies and methodologies, and they respect the expertise and contributions of their colleagues.
